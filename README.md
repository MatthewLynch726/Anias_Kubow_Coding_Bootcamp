I realized that since I didn't have enough of a grasp of the problem (That being Flexbox) that I am just going around blind.
What I am going to do now is simplify the problem in a way that is easy to see and change in order to really learn the systems that are causing this bug.

I am simplfying this problem by trying to recreate the layout using only divs that are bright colors so that I will be able to easily follow along. This layout is in the branch named Final_Layout.
