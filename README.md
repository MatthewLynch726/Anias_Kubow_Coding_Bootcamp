# Anias_Kubow_Coding_Bootcamp
 This is where I will store my files I used to work alongside this Coding Bootcamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm4BObh4MhI&list=LL&index=3&t=11227s

 In this tutorial I was able to learn more about css, javascript, and how to utlize 3rd part applications like bootstrap. I haven't finsihed the tutorial yet but I have enough to start using css and javascript in my projects.
